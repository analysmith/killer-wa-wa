#Checkpoint Part D# 

*Things that got done*

* GUI updated using the much faster matplotlib library.
* Orca community object created to facilitate communication.
* Environmental factors created.

*Things that did not get done*

* Orcas still can't quite communicate.
* Classifiers still need to be added.

*Lame excuse for the above*

* Illness + research

*Plan for overcoming setbacks*

* Make at least two updates per day.
* Committing something (however small) >> committing nothing
