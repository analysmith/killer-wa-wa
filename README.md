* This repository holds code for simulating orca behavior and language!
* v0.1 --> I plan on working on it later. This is only a beginning.... mwahahaha

### How do I get set up? ###

* Please read the project_3_x.pdf files. They help one understand the origins of the project.

 - scikit-learn
 - numpy
 - more to come
