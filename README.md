### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository holds code for simulating orca behavior and language!
* v0.1 --> I plan on working on it later. This is only a beginning.... mwahahaha

### How do I get set up? ###

* Please read the project_3_x.pdf files. They help one understand the origins of the project. 
* You'll need Python 2.6 at least to run the code.
* You'll also need some (pretty common) Python libraries:
     - scikit-learn
     - numpy
     - scipy
* If you have trouble running the code, you may want to consider installing [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/). It contains a number of Python libraries that are useful for scientific computing, and it's FREE.

### Contribution guidelines ###

No code contributions are being accepted at this time; however, please feel free to comment, nitpick, suggest, or otherwise positively verbally contribute.

### Running the simulation ###

1. Download directory.
2. cd into killer-wa-wa/code/
3. Enter 'python simulation.py' in your terminal.
4. Sit back and watch orcas eat stuff.

### Changing parameters ###

Some parameters can be adjusted through command line arguments.

* -o, --orcas [input: Number of orcas][def:10]
* -p, --prey [input: Number of prey][def:5]
* -d, --dim [input: Single int representing length of side of square world][def:100]
* -i, --num_iter [input: Number of time steps][def:200]
* -m, --mammal [indicator: use mammal prey][def:False]

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Ana Smith (gtskippy@gatech.edu)
