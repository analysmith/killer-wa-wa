TODO

- Environmental factors (e.g., icebergs, smells, beaches) should be fully implemented at this point.
- Agents should obey their restrictions imposed upon them upon the environment (e.g., whales lose the ability to walk on land :()
- Agents should be "aware" of their environment and learning from it. When I say "aware", I mean they should be observing environmental variables and transforming them into features. 
- The whales agents should be able to communicate with one another.

Fixed propagation method. Using shifting to cause diffusion.
Switching to all matrices. Will use hadamard product to compute smell values. This should make it easier to calculate values of squares for orcas.
Need to figure out communication aspect. Orcas may not be able to communicate complex actions. Maybe just use sound to increase orca happiness.
Step 1: Animals must move according to prefs.
Step 2: Orcas must be able to hunt.
Step 3: Decrease animals' health over time unless they eat.
