### FINAL CHECKPOINT ###

The end of this semester is nigh, but I thoroughly enjoyed working on this 
project. I anticipate continued work in this area, particularly regarding 
whale communication and agent strategies. To see how awesome this project is
with your own eyes, check out the README for instructions on running it.

** What Got Done **

* The killer whales learn strategies best suited for a particular type of prey. 
* Fish were more susceptible to communication aided attacks.
* Seals (mammals) were less susceptible to these attacks. 
* Only killer whales learn from past behaviors at this point. The fish and seals'
survival skills can be attributed to a simple desire to move away from the nearest 
orca.

** Directions for Future Work **

* Improve the strategy of seals so that they either seek land when they attack 
or perform some other action.
* Implement the orca life cycle such that orcas can mate and die from old age or 
starvation.
* Allow orcas to communicate by sharing experiences or classifier weights.
