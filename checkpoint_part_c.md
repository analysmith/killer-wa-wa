#Checkpoint Part C#

*Things that got done*
* Created classes to represent agents and environment.
* Added a few constants and a few untested simple behaviors like random movement.
* Made a first attempt at a cellular GUI. It's pretty crappy actually. 

*Things that didn't get done (and why)*
* Some new methods and maybe some enums will need to be created to fill out. Ultimately, these depend on the final software engineering scheme and therefore may need to be tweaked throughout the project.
* Agents are not quite interacting in the cellular GUI. This requires the proper implmentation of the GUI, which is currently pretty crappy. I may need to implement the GUI in another language to get the speed I need.
